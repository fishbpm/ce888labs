# Lab4 - Collaborative Filtering


## Submission 
* Please note I have only pushed the content that I have produced in the lab, and any immediate dependencies.
Other reference files originally cloned from the master repository are not included

	* the jupyter notebook - shows all experiments that were conducted

	* the source code file (.py) is also included - note this shows on the latest version. Earlier versions (for earlier experiments) are referenced in the jupyter notebook

	* any images (charts etc.) generated during the experiments


## Analysis (Overview) 
* Following points summarise the experimental findings as detailed in the Jupyter notebook

	* increasing the number of meta (latent) features improves the rate of convergence, as well as the residual error (after 100 cycles)

	* cycle time is very slow (30minutes to run 100 iterations)

	* increasing the learning rate did not improve results. It appears that longer cycles with smaller learning rate gives better results
